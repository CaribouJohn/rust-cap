# Rust application to read and search PCAPNG files

The purpose of this code is to 

* learn Rust and write code to practice
* implement a well defined spec (pcap file format)
* create something that will aid me in my work. 

I don't use Rust at work but I am keen to learn the language as I believe it has some useful and modern features. 

I am not intending that this code is any more than an aid at the moment and so if you find it useful fill your boots...

This code will be released under the Apache 2.0 lisence if I ever finish it...
